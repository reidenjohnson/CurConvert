# Overview

This project is a simple **Currency Converter** I built using JavaScript. The goal of this program was to learn how to interact with APIs, handle requests, and update the web page dynamically. I wanted to build something practical like a converter, that could demonstrate key JavaScrip basics like recursion, array methods, and API integration.

The app allows a user to enter an amount, choose a currency to convert from and to, and see the conversion result using live exchange rate data from an online API. It retries the API call automatically if it fails, which is handled using recursion.

# Development Environment

The program was created using:
- **Visual Studio Code** for development  
- **JavaScript** as the main language  
- **Axios** for HTTP requests  
- **HTML/CSS** for layout and styling  
- The browserâ€™s built-in console for debugging

# Useful Websites

These sites helped me understand and build the project:

# Future Work

Here are some ideas to improve or extend this project in the future:

- Add more currencies with flag icons for each option  
- Store the last used settings with `localStorage`  
- Add a chart to visualize historical exchange rates  
- Improve the design with a more responsive layout
